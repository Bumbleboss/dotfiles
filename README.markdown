# Coby's dotfiles

This is my collection of configuration and personalization files for
various applications I use on my system. My environment is mainly focused
around OSX, git, zsh, ruby (with rbenv), and vim.

My setup started out as a fork of [Ryan Bates' dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)
which worked for a while, but then I found [Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)
and I decided to try out his way of doing things, so it's highly likely
that anything you see here will have been blatantly stolen from either of
those to places â€” and there's also a chance it came from one of these fine
repos, too:

- [Ryan Tomayko's dotfiles](https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles)
- [thoughtbot's dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles)

## Installation

Here's how you will install these dotfiles.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cobyism/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ rake
```

Enjoy!
